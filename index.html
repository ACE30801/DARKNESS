			The day has come to an end. Sun sets. NIGHT HAS COME!!.<br>
		There will always be light - natural or artificial - it will always lead as where we want to go, but what is there when there is no light.<strong> There will be DARKNESS!</strong><br>
		There will be always darkness. Light is temporary but darkness is permanent. let's talk a little.<br>
		where have you been? You were lost?! but why? Sorry but i have been worried about you. OK, I'll leave you alone.<br>

		Your hour hand is moaning, and mine extends its hand out of the frame.<br>
		out of our mind. We are scared. We are coming to an end. Take us home.<br>
		Sadness, lost, agony.<br>
		What we were talking about?<br>
		Oh! Darkness. In fact darkness isn't a thing. It's the lack of the presence of light,<br>
		which prevent us from seeing objects, but this means that we actually need an object to feel the presence of light thus in absolute vaccum,<br>
		<strong>Their comes the DARKNESS.</strong>

		Make it for us hard
		Break again my heart
		'cause baby your an artist
		And my pain is the art

		Break my heart again		
		I want to feel your pain
		Make my life the darkest
		Let my tears make rain
